I'm Dhruv, a computer science undergrad who was born and brought up in Mumbai, India. Currently I'm studying at Manipal Institute of Technology. Here's my (slightly outdated) [Résumé](https://demoAccount0205.github.io/Resume.pdf).

I'm part of my University's [AI Robotics Team](http://projectmanas.in) where I'm the Head of AI. I spend my evenings at the workshop(Project MANAS) where i work alongside a team of 50+ members from different disciplines on developing our Autonomous car EVE and various other projects. I've interned at [Active.ai](https://active.ai/) as a machine learning intern where I got to work with basic NLP on differnt tasks.

I'm currently exploring Deep RL which has been quite exciting and I'm planning on experimenting with both Tensorflow and PyTorch while implementing the algorithms. I'm also interested in expanding my knowledge in Deep Unsupervised Learning which seems extremely intersting too.

This blog will be a bit more on the technical side, where I'll mostly write about the new stuff I learn. I'll mainly be writing about Deep Learning, RL and robotics.
